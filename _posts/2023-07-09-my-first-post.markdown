## Who am I?
I am Shreyas, brought up in Pune and grew up with all kinds of people. I love Music, Computers and Movies. I do watch shows too from time to time.  

Besides that I used to make music and I wish to get back into it ASAP. My top musical influences would be "All the music from 2000's", Kenny Beats, Marc Rebillet. I listen to all kinds of music though and I am currently enjoying the Indian Indie Music scene with ChaarDiwari, Karun, Nanku, Dhanji, Mehdi Maloof, Punit Singh etc. etc.

I have my bachelors in engineering from Pune University. I love learning more and more about computers and I cant keep myself off of them. I can spend hours tweaking my linux distro, theming my shell, improving my workflows, doing projects and even gaming ( God of War PC currently ).  

Lastly, my taste in movies is Tarantino, Fight Club, Birdman, Wasseypur, Imtiaz Ali and "Good Original Horror Movies". My taste in shows is the Breaking Bad Universe, The Office, Boston Legal, Sacred Games.

I hope I can find new entertainment and give out some recommendations here someday!

## What am I gonna do?

I plan to do a lot more projects and a lot more things in my life this year. Hence, I plan to document and share every thing I do / experience. This will also help me stay motivated, productive and accountable.  

So the content may range from Side Projects, Entertainment recommendations or opinions, Tech stuff, Gaming and Life in general as well.. who knows?

I plan to keep posting weekly andI already have the next post planned so see ya soon!
