# How I made this Blog

## using Angular 10 and Scully!



### Introduction

​	Before getting started with some actual content on my new blog, I have decided to post about how I have managed to create a **"Blazing Fast Blog with SEO"** by 2021 standards.

​	Before I started working on this project, i had no idea about **Static Site Generators (SSGs)** or **SEO**, but as I was working through this project, I picked it all up along the way. By the end of this post I hope you find everything you wanted to know about starting out with your own blog using Angular and Scully!

### Getting Started

To get started with Scully you need the following pre - requisites!

> - Angular versions: **v9.x.x** or **v10.x.x**
> - Node.js: **12** or higher

​	I just wanted to make the give the best web experience I could possibly give. I had minimal experience of Angular and Web Development in general so I started a regular Angular project with no plan.

```bash
ng new MyCustomBlog 	# Routing is necessary for Scully, say yes when prompted.
ng g c Homepage			# Landing page or the Home page for my blog.
```

**ROUTING IS NECESSARY FOR SCULLY SO ALWAYS ENABLE THAT**. Scully generates static pages by detecting all the routes first.

​	Some basic HTML and CSS and my landing page was ready in no time! (2 months of nitpicking, procrastination and choosing wallpapers, photos, fonts etc.).
