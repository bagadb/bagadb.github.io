# My plans with this blog.

------

#### It is so cool to have a completely personalized space on the internet, It can be anything you want. 

​	Earlier it used to be very difficult and extremely inconvenient to get it but now with Github Pages, everything is just perfect. There were always sites like Google's Blogger, WordPress, etc. but nothing matches the infinite possibilities offered by an easily accessible empty directory on the internet. A raw and extremely personalized channel of my thoughts and ideas, just one Google search or a few clicks away from any of my social profiles.

​	Being a person related to IT and Computers, having the "github.io" attached to my name does not feel weird at all. I couldn't imagine myself writing a blog called "bagadb.blogger.com " or WordPress, or even WIX, also I am a cheapskate. I won't spend a single Rupee on Hosting services and Cloud and what not. Who wants to deal with all that? and pay money for that? Not me!

​	Now that I have discovered Github Pages, I plan to take full advantage of this power.

#### Everything I learn, make, or discover will be (B)logged.

- My Projects
- My Experiences
- CTF Writeups, Security Research
- My Music Playlists and Recommendations
- and anything else that I think of at the moment!

#### Accountability can do wonders for productivity.

​	Finally, I believe this blog will motivate me to keep producing presentable and timely work. I can feel the pressure of an outdated blog already building up as I am writing this!

I hope to post again soon enough! Stay tuned!
